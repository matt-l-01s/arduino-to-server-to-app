Main Points for Presentation

1. Objectives, Themes and Challenges Faced
  Our system is a visitor monitoring system that can be used for security purposes.
  The system records visitors entering and leaving by recording a button press. 1 for entrance, 1 for exit.
  This system can control the number of visitors in a place on a certain day.
  This system can also determine number of visitors on a day.
  It also shows an alert if too many people are in 1 place
  The main theme of this project is COVID-19 and security.
  
  Some of the challenges we faced are balancing working together on the project with our classes and connecting the ESP and Android app to the server.

2. How it works
  Visitor pushes a button at entrance or exit
  Button presses are recorded by ESP every second
  ESP sends the button presses to a Python HTTP server every 10 seconds
  The server converts the data into a geojson file, along with the geographic data of the location
  The Android App receives the json file from the server and displays the data.
  
3. What we achieved
  We created the Arduino circuit with no issues
  We created Arduino code with interrupts so that button debouncing does not occur
  We created the Android App that displays our data to end users
  We successfully sent 6 bytes of data from our ESPs to the python server

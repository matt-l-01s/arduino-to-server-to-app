This repository was made for a global project based learning (gpbl) programme from 20/2/21 to 9/3/21. Thus, there will be no more updates to this repository.

The final version of the arduino code can be found at button_and_server_interrupt.ino

The code of the python server can be found at Server_team5.py

The code for the android app is not available.

The remaining files are simply test files used by us.
